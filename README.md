# Lane-Detection-using-MATLAB

This project implements a lane detection system using MATLAB that processes video frames to identify road lane markings. The system leverages color masking, edge detection, region-of-interest (ROI) filtering, and Hough transform-based line detection to identify and overlay lane lines on each frame of a driving video.

🎯 Features
Imports and processes real-time video frames.

Applies Gaussian filtering to reduce noise.

Masks frames based on color thresholds to detect yellow and white lane lines.

Uses Canny edge detection to find lane boundaries.

Applies ROI masking to isolate the region of interest.

Implements Hough Transform to detect straight lane lines.

Fits lines to detected edges and extrapolates them for visualization.

Generates and saves an output video with overlaid lane lines.

📂 Files in the Repository
lane_detection.m: Main MATLAB script for lane detection.

project_video.mp4: Input video file (add this manually if too large for GitHub).

roi_variables.mat: Pre-saved variables defining the ROI polygon (required for correct execution).

Result_krishna.avi: Output video file (saved after processing, can be generated by running the script).

🔧 How It Works
Video Import: Reads the video file frame-by-frame.

Color Masking: Segments the image into yellow and white masks based on HSV thresholding.

Edge Detection: Uses Canny edge detection on each color mask.

Region of Interest: Filters out irrelevant parts of the frame using preloaded ROI variables.

Hough Transform: Detects straight lines within the ROI.

Line Fitting: Finds the best-fit lines and extrapolates them.

Visualization: Overlays the detected lane lines onto the original frames.

Video Output: Saves the resulting processed frames into an output video.

▶️ How to Run
Ensure MATLAB is installed.

Clone the repository and navigate to the folder.

Place project_video.mp4 and roi_variables.mat in the same directory as the script.

Run lane_detection.m in the MATLAB environment.

The result will be saved as Result_krishna.avi.

🧠 Requirements
MATLAB (R2021a or newer recommended)

Image Processing Toolbox

📌 Notes
Adjust thresholds for different lighting conditions or videos.

ROI coordinates are pre-saved in roi_variables.mat. To customize the region, use ginput() to define new points and save them.
